1. Application Description
A fun simple gambling app that takes classic games and puts them into one app. On start the user will be taken to our home activity that 
displays three images. Each one takes the user to the appropriate game they clicked. All games included are Slot Machine, Black Jack, and 
Roulette Wheel. The user can play the game for as long as they want and when they want to switch games they can press the home button to 
go back to Main activity to select their next game.

# Slot Machine

# Black Jack
Simple setup, the user is presented two buttons when activity opens, START and HOME. If user hits start the start button is hidden with 
buttons reset, draw and hold becoming visible. User can select to draw or hold depending on their value shown in the TextView towards the 
bottom that displays Score and Host Score. If user busts (goes over 21) OR once hold is used and host gets a higher score 
without busting dialog lost displays. If host busts OR fails to get a score higher than user dialog win displays.

# Roulette Wheel
The start screen shows a roulette wheel with a home button, a place bet button, and a spin button.  The home button takes the user back to the app's main screen.  The bet button opens up a screen where the user can place a bet based on color, number, etc.  The user can place how much they would like to bet on the spin as well.  The user then selects the spin button to spin the wheel and depending on the bet and results of the spin a message is prompted letting the user know how much they won/lost on that spin.
