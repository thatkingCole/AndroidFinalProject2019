A fun simple gambling app that takes classic games and puts them into one app. On start the user will be taken to our home activity that 
displays three images. Each one takes the user to the appropriate game they clicked. All games included are Slot Machine, Black Jack, and 
Roulette Wheel. The user can play the game for as long as they want and when they want to switch games they can press the home button to 
go back to Main activity to select their next game.

buttons reset, draw and hold becoming visible. User can select to draw or hold depending on their value shown in the TextView towards the
